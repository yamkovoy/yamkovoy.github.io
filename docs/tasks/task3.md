Plans provide product clients with a variety of service options defined within a preconfigured score.

Please note that shortly after the feature implementation, your customer service flow and solutions may undergo some alignment due to an extensive system update. To be more precise, a user record is now supplemented by additional properties, which are described in the latest version of our API reference. For example, the users can be transferred to the 'idle' state before they confirm purchasing a plan.

The capacity of plans per provider is unlimited, so feel free to create as many of them as necessary and customize them to up to a desirable extent. Despite that, plans - merely surface well-known user attributes complying completely with the corresponding state flaw.

# Text Review

Subscription plans provide LuminaLab's users with a variety of service options defined within the [preconfigured scope](placeholder.md).

The amount of plans per provider is unlimited, so it is possible to create as many plans as necessary and customize them to the partner's preferences.

::: tip Note

Shortly after a user subscribes to a plan, their service flow may undergo certain adjustments due to an extensive system update.

This is due to a user's record being supplemented with additional properties, which are described in the latest version of our [API specification](task2.md) (e.g., once a user subscribes to a plan, they are transferred to the `signing` state until their purchase is confirmed).
